# Breast Cancer Analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This repository analyzes the **Breast Cancer** dataset to classify cases as malignant or benign using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The model is evaluated with a confusion matrix to measure its performance.

## Project Contents
- **Dataset**: Includes features like cell texture, perimeter, and smoothness, labeled as malignant or benign.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, scaling, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Implementation of the **SVM Classifier**.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix analysis to assess predictions and calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breast-Cancer-SVM.git
